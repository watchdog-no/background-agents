/**
 * The jobs seam over Cloudflare Queues: one Queue per job kind. A message
 * carries the kind's payload alone, and the kind is recovered from the
 * queue it arrived on. That wire shape predates the seam and stays: a queue
 * holds messages across a deploy, and the autofix producer is a different
 * Worker on its own release cycle, so an envelope with the kind inside
 * would open a skew window for nothing.
 *
 * Terraform names each queue `<prefix>-<deployment name>`, the deployment
 * name being the `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` the Worker is configured with, so a
 * batch is routed by the exact name and a dead-letter queue
 * (`<prefix>-dlq-<deployment name>`) is never mistaken for a live one.
 * Terraform also declares each consumer's `max_retries` and `retry_delay`;
 * `job-queue.test.ts` holds those equal to the kind's `JobRetryPolicy`, so
 * the two cannot drift.
