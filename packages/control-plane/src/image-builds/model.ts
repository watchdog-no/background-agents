/**
 * Domain terms for image builds.
 *
 * An image build bakes a provider-opaque prebuilt artifact for a *scope* — an
 * environment (an ordered repository set) or, once the repo scope lands, a
 * single repository. The artifact is provider-opaque (Modal image id, Vercel
 * snapshot id, OpenComputer checkpoint id); code outside provider adapters
 * treats those ids as opaque. Drift is tracked per repository
 * (`repository_shas`) and spawn selection is gated by the runtime version
 * baked at build time.
