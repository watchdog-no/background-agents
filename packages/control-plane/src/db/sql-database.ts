/**
 * Engine-neutral SQL port for the global data layer.
 *
 * The surface is exactly what the src/db stores use today — nothing more.
 * D1Database satisfies this interface structurally (proven below), so no
 * wrapper object exists at runtime; the port is erased at build time.
 *
 * Members use method syntax deliberately: method parameters are checked
 * bivariantly, which is what lets D1Database.batch(D1PreparedStatement[])
 * satisfy batch(SqlStatement[]). Do not convert these to arrow-function
 * property signatures.
 *
 * Contract the type system cannot express: statements passed to batch() must
 * originate from the same database's prepare(). Adapters must tolerate or
 * unwrap foreign statements (see ORIGINAL_STMT in instrumented-d1.ts, which
 * exists exactly because wrapped statements cross into the raw db.batch()).
 *
 * Not to be confused with the session Durable Object's synchronous
 * `SqlStorage` (src/session/repository.ts) — that is a different engine with
 * a load-bearing sync contract, and is intentionally not covered by this port.
