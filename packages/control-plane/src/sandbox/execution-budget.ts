/**
 * How long a session may spend processing one message before the control plane

 *
 * On providers that support it, `sandboxTimeoutMs` is also the sandbox's TTL,
 * so a session cannot outlive it. Unsupported legacy values are ignored. When
 * it is unset, the deployment-wide `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS` applies, and failing
 * that the default sandbox lifetime.
 *
 * Both the session's own watchdog and the scheduler's lost-run sweep read the
 * budget through here. They resolve it from different places — the session
 * from its persisted settings snapshot, the scheduler from the settings it is
 * about to launch the session with — and a run whose backstop expires before
 * the session it is watching is exactly the failure this exists to prevent.
