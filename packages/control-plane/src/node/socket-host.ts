/**
 * NodeWebSocketHost — the session's `SessionWebSocketHost` over `ws` sockets.
 *
 * The HTTP host upgrades a connection and hands the runtime the `ws` socket;
 * this host adopts it under the runtime's tags, enumerates it, answers the
 * platform-level keepalive without waking the runtime, and forwards message,
 * close, and error events to the session server with the signatures the
 * Durable Object adapter uses.
 *
 * Unlike the Durable Object runtime, this host owns inbound flow control.
 * Events from one socket are delivered one at a time in arrival order. The
 * socket is paused before each delivery starts and resumed when its queue
 * empties, so the peer's bytes wait in the kernel rather than on the heap;
 * only the frames `ws` had already decoded from the read in progress queue
 * behind an in-flight delivery, up to `maxPendingDeliveries`. A peer that
 * exceeds that bound is closed with `WS_CLOSE_TRY_AGAIN_LATER`. A handler that never settles holds
 * only its own socket; bounding handler time is the session executor's
 * concern, which is whatever `bindEventSink` receives.
 *
 * A host and the runtime it is bound to share one lifetime: the registry
 * builds them together and retires them together, and a runtime with open
 * sockets is never retired underneath them. There is no re-binding.
