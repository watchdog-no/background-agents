/**
 * The Node host's jobs table: `<dataDir>/jobs.db`.
 *
 * Cloudflare hands a job to a Queue and the platform redelivers it until a
 * consumer acknowledges. A container has no queue service, so the same
 * guarantee is a row: `send` writes one, the poller claims it, and the row
 * lives until a handler is done with it.
 *
 * A claim is a **lease**, as a queue's invisibility window is. Claiming
 * writes a fresh token and an expiry; settling names the token, so a
 * delivery that comes back after its lease expired cannot settle the
 * redelivery that replaced it. Two things end a claim early, and they answer
 * different questions asked at different moments: at boot every claim on disk
 * belongs to a process that is gone (`recoverAllClaims`, called once before
 * any poller runs, because only one host may hold this volume), and while
 * running, a claim whose lease has run out belongs to a handler that hung
 * (`recoverExpiredClaims`, on every sweep). The cost of both is Cloudflare's
 * own: two deliveries of one job can overlap, which `jobs.ts` already
 * requires every handler to tolerate.
 *
 * Neither recovery refunds an attempt. The attempt is counted when the job
 * is claimed, exactly as a queue counts a delivery however it ended, so a
 * job whose handler takes the process down with it still runs out of
 * attempts and reaches the dead rows instead of being redelivered for ever.
 *
 * It is deliberately not part of the global store, whose schema is
 * `terraform/d1/migrations` and lands on D1 as well: nothing on Cloudflare
 * reads a jobs table. This is the arrangement the host alarm index and the
 * cache file already use — a Node-local file whose schema is a
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in code, applied on open.
 *
 * Litestream does not replicate it, and that is a decision with a condition
 * attached. Every job the control plane produces today is
 * `image_build.finalize`, which the image-build scheduler republishes from
 * the global store on its cron slot (`listRecoverableFinalizations`: a build
 * still `building` with an accepted completion and no live lease). So a lost
 * volume loses no work, only time — the same reasoning that leaves the alarm
 * index unreplicated, where the session's own file re-arms the deadline. A
 * job kind that is *not* reconstructible from replicated state — session
 * callbacks, when those move onto this seam — has to revisit that.
 *
 * A row carries a status rather than a nullable slot per state, because
 * `dead` is a real destination here and not the absence of one: it is what a
 * dead-letter queue holds on the other host, kept with the error that put it
 * there. `run_at` is read only while a job is pending.
