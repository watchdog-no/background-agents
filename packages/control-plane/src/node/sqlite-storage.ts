/**
 * Session storage over `node:sqlite`: the `SqlStorage` + `TransactionSync`
 * surface a Durable Object supplies, backed by an in-process database, so the
 * session core runs unchanged on a Node host.
 *
 * `node:sqlite` was chosen over better-sqlite3 because it ships with the Node
 * release CI already pins (unflagged since 22.13), so the host adds no native
 * dependency to install or rebuild. better-sqlite3 exposes the same
 * prepare/run/all shape and is the fallback if a gap appears here.
 *
 * Statement boundaries come from the prepared statements' own extents. The
 * only SQL text recognized here is statement-less trivia, which must be
 * filtered before prepare() because affected Node 22/24 releases mishandle the
 * null statement SQLite returns for such input. Rows come from stepping the
 * last statement, and the write count comes from SQLite's change counter.
 * Foreign keys are enforced, as they are in Durable Object storage. The
 * conformance suite (test/conformance) pins every semantic the core relies on
 * to what the Durable Object does, including nested transactions as savepoints.
