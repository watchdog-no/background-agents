/**
 * The Node host's HTTP server: the control-plane app behind a fetch
 * listener, `/healthz` answered ahead of it, and WebSocket upgrades routed
 * to the session upgrade path.
 *
 * Requests the app is handling are tracked so a shutdown can wait for them:
 * `server.close()` only stops new connections, and a handler that has
 * yielded resumes after it. The upgrade boundary is total: whatever the
 * upgrade path throws is logged and the raw socket is destroyed, so no
 * failure becomes an unhandled rejection and no peer is left hanging.
