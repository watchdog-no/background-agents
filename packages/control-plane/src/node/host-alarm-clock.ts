/**
 * The Node host's alarm: one timer for the whole process, armed for the
 * soonest deadline in the host alarm index, delivering to each session
 * through the host's `deliver` callback (which opens the session if it was
 * evicted and runs its scheduled-deadline handler).
 *
 * `storeFor(sessionId)` is the per-session `AlarmScheduleStore` the session
 * runtime is built over: what a Durable Object's `ctx.storage` alarm methods
 * provide. Setting a deadline records it in the index and re-arms the
 * timer. Firing *claims* the record: the session reads as disarmed while
 * its handler runs, as the platform clears a Durable Object's alarm when it
 * fires, so a handler that arms a new deadline replaces nothing; the claim
 * itself stays on disk until the delivery settles, so a process that dies
 * mid-delivery fires it again at the next start.
 *
 * A failed delivery is retried on the platform's policy (doubling backoff
 * from two seconds, six retries), sooner if the session armed something
 * sooner; the count lives in the index, so a restart does not renew it.
 * After the last attempt the host stops retrying on its own; the session
 * file still holds the deadline, and the session's next activation re-arms
 * it through `rehydrate()`, which is also what happens on Cloudflare once
 * the platform gives up on an alarm.
 *
 * Deliveries run concurrently across sessions up to a bound, so a host that
 * comes back after downtime opens overdue sessions a few at a time rather
 * than all at once; the next ones start as soon as one settles.
 *
 * Every claim is a lease, held by the delivery that took it. Settling names
 * that token, so a claim recovered from a process that is gone cannot be
 * settled by a delivery that outlived it, and starting twice never takes a
 * claim away from a delivery still running here.
 *
 * When a lease runs out in a live process the clock stops counting that
 * delivery against the concurrency bound, so one handler that never returns
 * cannot narrow the clock for every other session. It does *not* redeliver
 * that session. The promise cannot be cancelled, the registry's leases count
 * rather than exclude, and the session's own alarm state carries no claim
 * token — so a second delivery would run into the same runtime beside the
 * first, and the stale one could clear a deadline the new one owns. Until
 * that fence reaches the session core, the abandoned session stays excluded
 * and its claim stays on disk, for the next start to recover.
 *
 * Polling, delivery and arming are total: an index that throws is logged and
 * the timer re-armed — behind a backoff, so a failure that persists is not a
 * spin — never left as an unhandled rejection from a timer task.
