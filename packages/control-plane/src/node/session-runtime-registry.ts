/**
 * SessionRuntimeRegistry — the Node host's counterpart to one Durable
 * Object per session: it opens a session runtime on first touch, keeps it
 * resident while something is happening, and retires it when nothing is.
 *
 * Per session the registry does what `SessionDO` does per activation: open
 * the session's store, build the platform record over the host's adapters,
 * build the runtime, publish it only once the whole graph exists (a throw
 * leaves nothing behind, so the next event retries), and rehydrate the
 * runtime's alarm unless an alarm delivery joined the activation. Events
 * then reach the runtime through `withRuntime` and `deliverScheduledDeadline`,
 * and socket events through the host the registry binds to it.
 *
 * A runtime is `opening`, `resident`, `quiescing` (shutdown), or `retired`.
 * Only the transitions are serialized: every event on a runtime holds an
 * activity lease, taken in the same continuation that checks the runtime
 * is resident, so a runtime with a lease is never retired underneath it.
 *
 * Residency reproduces the platform's economics. A runtime stays resident
 * while it has adopted sockets, running background tasks, or a lease held,
 * and for `idleAfterMs` after its last activity; one whose next deadline is
 * within `deadlineHorizonMs` stays too, since the alarm would only reopen
 * it. Otherwise the sweep closes its store and drops it, and the next event
 * opens it again from the file. `maxResident` bounds memory: publishing
 * beyond it retires the least recently active quiescent runtime, and if
 * none is, the bound is exceeded and logged rather than enforced against
 * live work. A runtime with open sockets is never retired underneath them:
 * the socket host and the runtime are a one-shot pair.
 *
 * Session files are the durable store. The registry creates one for any
 * well-formed id (existence is the caller's check, as the Worker checks the
 * index before reaching a Durable Object) and never deletes one; only an
 * explicit archive or delete route may.
