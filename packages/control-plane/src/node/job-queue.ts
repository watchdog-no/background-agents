/**
 * The Node host's wiring of the jobs seam: `send` writes a row and one timer
 * for the whole process delivers what is due.
 *
 * This is the container's answer to a Cloudflare Queue consumer, and it
 * keeps that consumer's contract. `deliverJob` is the same entry point on
 * both hosts, so parsing, handler failures and the retry answer are decided
 * in one place; what differs is only who enforces the policy. Cloudflare
 * enforces `max_retries` and `retry_delay` from the queue consumer's
 * settings; here the kind's own `JobRetryPolicy` does it, which is what
 * `job-queue.test.ts` holds equal to the deployed settings.
 *
 * A job out of attempts becomes `dead` rather than being dropped: that row,
 * with the error that ended it, is what the dead-letter queue holds on the
 * other host. Nothing consumes or sweeps it; it is there to be seen, and it
 * is counted in the health report. A completed job's row goes at once, so
 * the table grows only by what failed for good.
 *
 * Jobs run concurrently up to a bound, so a host coming back to a backlog
 * works through it a few at a time; the next ones start as soon as one
 * settles. Starting the poller takes back every claim no delivery here owns,
 * so a job the process that died was running is retried at once instead of
 * waiting out its lease. Every claim is a lease, and when a lease runs out
 * the poller lets go of that delivery in both places at once: the row goes
 * back to pending, and the slot it held stops counting against the bound. A
 * hung handler therefore costs one lease, not a permanently narrower queue —
 * and it cannot corrupt the redelivery that replaces it, because settling is
 * fenced on the claim token it no longer owns.
 *
 * Polling, delivery and arming are total: a store that throws is logged and
 * the timer re-armed, never left as an unhandled rejection from a timer task.
 * The poller schedules itself only for the kinds it can actually claim, so a
 * job left for a newer build waits quietly instead of being polled for.
