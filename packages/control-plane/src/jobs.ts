/**
 * The control plane's background jobs: one table that every host delivers
 * from. A producer calls `env.JOBS.send(job)`, and the job is durable before
 * `send` resolves. A host later hands the payload back to its kind's
 * handler, with the delivery count, and the handler answers `"ack"` or asks
 * for a retry. Nothing outside the hosts' adapters sees a queue.
 *
 * On Cloudflare each kind is a Queue (`cloudflare/job-queue.ts`) whose
 * consumer Terraform declares with the retry settings below; a unit test
 * holds the two equal. A future Node jobs table and poller can deliver the
 * same registry; until then that host exposes JOBS as null.
 *
 * Retry taxonomy. Delivery is at-least-once on every host, so a handler
 * must tolerate a duplicate: image-build finalization is fenced by a store
 * lease and a completion hash, and the autofix ledger is keyed by the
 * provider object. Both kinds retry on failure until `maxAttempts`, then
 * dead-letter. A payload that does not parse, or a handler that throws, is
 * retried on the same terms rather than dropped: a poison message ends in
 * the dead-letter queue, where an operator (and, for autofix, the queue
 * health check) can see it.
