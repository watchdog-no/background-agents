/**
 * Recover the content of Slack messages that were shared (forwarded) into a
 * message the bot handles.
 *
 * Forwarding a message does not put its body in the new message's `text` —
 * `text` holds only whatever the user typed alongside it ("take a look at
 * this"). The shared message arrives as a *message attachment* flagged
 * `is_share` (and may also have `is_msg_unfurl`), carrying its own author,
 * source channel, permalink, body, and any files it had. Reading only `text`
 * therefore hands the agent a bare pronoun and drops the thing the user was
 * pointing at.
 *
 * Everything the attachment carries is recovered: the body and its links are
 * quoted verbatim, images flow into the same session-attachment path as
 * directly attached ones, and the permalink plus channel id and message ts go
 * into the prompt so an agent with Slack tooling can pull the full thread.
 *
 * Link unfurls land in the same `attachments` array but are skipped: they
 * restate a page the message text already links to, and their `text` is usually
 * boilerplate ("Monitor your errors") rather than content.
