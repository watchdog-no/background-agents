"""Verify the Docker image variant on the runtime it will be launched with.

Runs inside the candidate Docker image on a Modal VM, using the production
DockerService as the daemon owner. It proves the daemon reaches readiness on
overlay2, that a build, a container and a Compose network work without any
registry, and that the daemon stops cleanly the way an image build requires.
