"""Foreground-supervised Docker daemon for Docker-enabled sandboxes.

The runtime supervisor owns ``dockerd`` as an ordinary child process: it is
started before repository hooks, watched for the life of the session, stopped
cleanly before an image build reports success, and reaped on shutdown. Nothing
backgrounds or detaches it, and no remote exec ever owns it.

Raw daemon and probe output is deliberately not forwarded into the structured
log: registry errors and container metadata can carry repository secrets. The
daemon writes to a log file inside the sandbox for users; the runtime emits
only fixed lifecycle events.
