"""Supervisor-to-bridge boot channel: one append-only JSONL file per boot.

The supervisor has no control-plane socket of its own. While the repository
boots it appends one JSON object per line here — boot phases (``kind:
phase``) and non-fatal warnings (``kind: warning``) — and the bridge tails
the file and relays each line to the control plane as a ``boot_progress`` or
``warning`` sandbox event. ``seq`` is monotonic per boot so a relay that
reconnects can resend its latest phase without it being observed twice; the
supervisor truncates the file at process start so a restarted supervisor
never replays an earlier boot.
