"""Bridge-side reader for the supervisor's boot-events file.

Tails ``BOOT_EVENTS_FILE_PATH`` (see ``boot_events.py`` for the writer and
the line shapes) and maps each line to the sandbox event the control plane
understands: ``kind: phase`` becomes ``boot_progress`` with ``seq`` carried as
``bootSeq`` and ``at`` as ``timestamp``; ``kind: warning`` becomes ``warning``.
Remembers the latest phase so a reconnect can resend it once, and notices
the ``harness completed`` line that tells the bridge to attach its harness.
