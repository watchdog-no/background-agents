# It is an ordinary `.env` entry -- docker-compose.aws.yml reads it, and
# `open-inspect-fetch-config` materializes it from SSM on every start -- which
# is what makes a deploy a parameter write plus a restart rather than a new
# instance. But a deploy has to be able to move it, and roll it back, without a
# `terraform apply`: CI knows the digest it just pushed and Terraform does not.
# So the module creates it at `control_plane_image_tag` for the first boot and
# `ignore_changes` leaves every later value alone. Same boundary as the secrets
# above, for the same reason.
#
# The consequence worth knowing: after the first deploy, `control_plane_image`
# and `control_plane_image_tag` no longer describe what is running.
# `terraform output deployed_image_parameter` names where that lives.
# Before CI owned it, this same SSM name was one entry in the map above. Without
# this, an upgrade plans a destroy and a create against one name, and whichever
# order it picks either fails or resets the value CI last deployed.
