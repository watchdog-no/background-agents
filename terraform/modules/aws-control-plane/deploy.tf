# How CI reaches this deployment, and nothing else.
#
# GitHub Actions authenticates with an OIDC token rather than an access key, so
# there is no long-lived AWS credential in the repository. The token's `sub`
# claim names the repository *and the GitHub environment the job requested*, and
# the trust policy pins both -- which is what makes a GitHub environment's
# approval gate an AWS access gate too, rather than a UI convention a workflow
# edit can route around.
#
# Null `github_deploy` creates none of this, and the environment is deployed by
# hand. That is the default: an installation with no GitHub Actions has no
# reason to carry a federated role.
