-- PR outcome timestamps for analytics (docs/pr-analytics-design.md §3): when a
-- pull request was created, merged, and closed according to the provider.
-- provider_updated_at cannot answer these — it keeps drifting after merge
-- (comments bump GitHub's updated_at) and our updated_at is overwritten on
-- every upsert.
--
-- All nullable, epoch ms. No backfill (same philosophy as 0041): the webhook
-- and read-through write paths carry the provider values and repair existing
-- rows on next contact. Analytics buckets PR creation by
-- COALESCE(provider_created_at, created_at) — exact for creation-path rows,
-- corrected by the provider value for fallback-inserted rows.
--
-- merged_at is only meaningful when lifecycle_state = 'merged'; closed_at only
-- when the PR is not open (clears on reopen). Enforced in snapshotToRecord —
-- the single snapshot→record mapping every writer flows through — rather than
-- CHECK constraints (SQLite ADD COLUMN cannot add table-level CHECKs).

-- The PR analytics endpoint range-scans the cohort expression and merged_at
-- on every dashboard refresh; these keep those reads off full table scans as
-- the PR table grows. The expression index matches the exact COALESCE the
-- queries use (prCreatedAtExpr in pull-request-analytics-store.ts).
