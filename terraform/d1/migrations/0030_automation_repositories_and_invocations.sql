-- Multi-repo automations: normalized repository selection + first-class
-- invocation records.
--
-- Model: every firing of an automation is one automation_invocations row. A
-- skipped firing is a childless invocation carrying skip_reason; a started
-- firing has one automation_runs child per repository (a repo-less automation
-- has one null-repo child). Invocation status is DERIVED from its children —
-- never stored. automation_runs keeps its shipped meaning: the per-repository,
-- session-linked unit.
--
-- The backfill statements below are each guarded (NOT EXISTS / IS NULL), so
-- re-running them is idempotent — that is the roll-forward repair path for
-- invocation-less legacy runs. The schema changes (ALTER ... ADD COLUMN) are
-- NOT re-runnable (SQLite has no ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS), so the runner
-- applies this file exactly once via _schema_migrations; a manual repair
-- re-runs the guarded backfills, not the whole file.

-- ── 1. Repository selection ────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Single source of truth for an automation's repositories (0..N rows). The
-- scalar automations.repo_* columns are frozen after this migration: new code
-- reads only this table and keeps a single transitional dual-write of the
-- scalars for 0/1-repository automations (rollback cover) until the columns
-- are dropped in a later contract migration.

-- Backfill from the scalar columns. TRIM/LOWER matches the write-side
-- normalization (normalizeOptionalRepositoryPair in @open-inspect/shared);
-- NULLIF scrubs legacy blank values that predate it, and the pair guard skips
-- rows where scrubbing leaves only half a pair.

-- ── 2. Invocations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Thin row: identity + firing-scoped keys + skip/bookkeeping. No status, no
-- expected_runs, no completed_at — all derived from children. trigger_key /
-- concurrency_key / trigger_metadata describe firings, not per-repo work, so
-- they live here (the matching automation_runs columns are frozen: new rows
-- leave them NULL).

-- ── 3. Run linkage + repository snapshot ───────────────────────────────────
-- Snapshot columns are written at firing time from the resolved repository
-- set, so history never depends on the live selection (repo-set edits apply
-- from the next invocation; in-flight invocations complete against the set
-- they resolved).

ALTER TABLE automation_runs ADD COLUMN invocation_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE automation_runs ADD COLUMN repo_owner TEXT;
ALTER TABLE automation_runs ADD COLUMN repo_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE automation_runs ADD COLUMN repo_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE automation_runs ADD COLUMN base_branch TEXT;

-- ── 4. Backfill legacy history into invocations of 1 ───────────────────────
-- One invocation per existing run, reusing the run's id (distinct id spaces,
-- so no collision hazard). Source labeling: trigger_key marks event firings;
-- schedule and legacy manual firings are indistinguishable and both get
-- 'schedule' (documented, harmless — scheduled_at was NOT NULL on every
-- legacy run, so the CHECK holds). failure_counted_at is stamped on failed
-- rows so the recovery sweep's finalization arm does not re-count strikes
-- that the legacy accounting already took.
--
-- Idempotency-index precondition: idx_runs_idempotency has enforced
-- UNIQUE(automation_id, scheduled_at) across ALL legacy runs since migration
-- 0013, which is what lets this backfill satisfy idx_invocations_idempotency
-- for the rows labeled 'schedule'. Step 5 below drops that runs-side index,
-- so this ordering is load-bearing.
-- (IIF instead of CASE throughout this file: wrangler's migration splitter
-- treats a bare END as a compound-block terminator and would glue every
-- following statement into this one.)

-- fabricate history. Runs without sessions (legacy skips, failed-before-

-- not store repo_id, so backfilled snapshots leave it NULL. Legacy sessions
-- may predate write-side normalization, so normalize + pair-guard here.

-- idx_runs_trigger_key is deliberately KEPT: new-pipeline children leave

-- pre-invocations code still relies on it for event dedup. It is dropped
-- together with the frozen run columns in the follow-up contract migration.
