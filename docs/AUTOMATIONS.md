# Automations

Automations let you run coding agents either on a recurring schedule or when an external event
arrives. Define the repository configuration, model, and instructions once, then Open-Inspect starts
a new session whenever the trigger fires.

Trigger types:

| Trigger Type        | Description                               | Availability       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Schedule**        | Run on a cron schedule                    | Available          |
| **Inbound Webhook** | Trigger from any system with an HTTP POST | Available          |
| **Sentry Alert**    | Trigger from a Sentry Custom Integration  | Available          |
| **Slack Message**   | Trigger on messages in watched channels   | Available (opt-in) |
| **GitHub Event**    | Trigger on GitHub activity                | Planned            |
| **Linear Event**    | Trigger on Linear activity                | Planned            |

Common use cases include nightly dependency updates, reacting to deploy or incident events, triaging
new Sentry issues, and recurring report generation.

## Creating an Automation

Navigate to **Automations** in the sidebar, then click **Create Automation**.

Start by choosing a **Trigger Type**. The rest of the form adjusts based on that choice.

### Required Fields

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trigger Type**             | How the automation starts: schedule, inbound webhook, Sentry alert, or Slack message.                                                                                                      |
| **Name**                     | A short label for the automation (max 200 characters). Appears in the automations list and in session titles prefixed with `[Auto]`.                                                       |
| **Repository Configuration** | Choose **Single repository** to clone one repository and branch, or **No repository** to run without a cloned code workspace.                                                              |
| **Repository**               | Required for single-repo automations. Only repositories installed on the GitHub App are available.                                                                                         |
| **Instructions**             | The prompt sent to the coding agent each time the automation fires (max 15,000 characters). Write this as you would a normal session prompt and reference the trigger context when useful. |

### Optional Fields

| Field          | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branch**     | The base branch for each session. Defaults to the repository's default branch (usually `main`).   |
| **Model**      | The AI model to use. Defaults to the system default model.                                        |
| **Reasoning**  | Optional reasoning level for models that support it.                                              |
| **Conditions** | Optional trigger filters for event-driven automations such as inbound webhooks and Sentry alerts. |

### Trigger-Specific Fields

| Trigger Type        | Additional Fields                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Schedule**        | **Schedule** and **Timezone**                                                                |
| **Inbound Webhook** | No extra required fields                                                                     |
| **Sentry Alert**    | **Event Type** and **Sentry Client Secret**                                                  |
| **Slack Message**   | **Conditions** (a Slack Channel condition is required; a Message Text condition is optional) |

For non-schedule automations, schedule fields are not used.

---

## Repository Context

Automations can run with or without repository context:

- **Single repository**: clone one configured repository and branch for each run.
- **No repository**: no repository is cloned. The agent still starts a normal session and can use
  configured tools such as MCP servers, but repo workspace actions like opening pull requests
  require repository context.

---

## Inbound Webhooks

Use **Inbound Webhook** when you want any external system to trigger an automation with a JSON
payload. This is the most flexible event-driven option and works well for internal tools,
deployments, monitoring systems, scheduled jobs, and custom integrations.

### How It Works

1. Create an automation with **Trigger Type = Inbound Webhook**.
2. Copy the generated webhook URL and API key shown after creation.
3. Send an authenticated HTTP `POST` request with a JSON body.
4. Open-Inspect prepends a webhook context block to your automation instructions and starts a new
   session if the request matches the automation's conditions.

### Setup Notes

- The webhook URL and API key are shown after the automation is created.
- The API key is only shown once, so store it when you create the automation.
- The automation detail page shows the webhook path for reference.
- Webhook automations do not use schedule or timezone settings.

### Request Requirements

Inbound webhooks must meet all of the following requirements:

| Requirement          | Value                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Method               | `POST`                            |
| Content-Type         | `application/json`                |
| Authentication       | `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` |
| Maximum payload size | 64 KB                             |

Any valid JSON body is accepted.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<your-worker-url>/webhooks/automation/<automation-id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"deploy.failed","service":"api","environment":"prod"}'
```

### What the Agent Receives

For each accepted request, Open-Inspect prepends a context block to your instructions that includes:

- The fact that the automation was triggered by an inbound webhook
- The time the webhook was received
- The JSON payload, truncated if necessary
- A warning to treat the payload as untrusted input data, not as instructions

Write your automation instructions assuming the agent will read both your saved prompt and the
incoming payload together.

### Filtering with Conditions

Webhook automations support one condition type: **JSONPath Filter**.

Use conditions when you want the automation to run only for specific payload shapes or values, such
as:

- Only production events
- Only deploy failures
- Only payloads that include a specific field

Each JSONPath condition contains one or more filters, and **all filters must match** for the
automation to run.

Supported comparisons:

| Comparison | Meaning                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `eq`       | Equal to                  |
| `neq`      | Not equal to              |
| `gt`       | Greater than              |
| `gte`      | Greater than or equal to  |
| `lt`       | Less than                 |
| `lte`      | Less than or equal to     |
| `contains` | String contains substring |
| `exists`   | Field is present          |

Supported path syntax is limited to simple dot notation such as `$.event.type` or
`$.deployment.environment`.

Not supported:

- Array indexing
- Recursive descent
- Full JSONPath expressions

Example filters:

| Goal                             | Filter                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Run only for production          | `$.environment eq "production"` |
| Run only for failed deploys      | `$.status eq "failed"`          |
| Run only when a field is present | `$.pull_request.number exists`  |

### Idempotency and Duplicate Deliveries

If your sender may retry the same event, include an `idempotencyKey` field in the JSON body.

When present, Open-Inspect uses that value to deduplicate repeated deliveries of the same logical
event. Re-sending the same `idempotencyKey` will not create duplicate runs.

The `idempotencyKey` remains in the stored webhook body, but it is omitted from the context block
shown to the agent.

If you do not provide an `idempotencyKey`, each webhook delivery gets its own concurrency key. That
means separate deliveries for the same automation can run at the same time.

### Responses

Successful requests return JSON in this shape:

```json
{ "ok": true, "triggered": 1, "skipped": 0 }
```

`triggered` is the number of automation runs started.

`skipped` is the number of matching runs that were ignored because of duplicate delivery or
concurrency protection.

### Error Responses

| Status | Meaning                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `400`  | Invalid JSON body                                |
| `401`  | Missing or invalid API key                       |
| `404`  | Automation not found or not a webhook automation |
| `413`  | Payload too large                                |
| `415`  | `Content-Type` was not `application/json`        |

## Slack Message Triggers

A **Slack Message** automation starts a session when someone posts a matching message in a watched
Slack channel. Unlike `@mention` sessions (which are explicit, interactive requests), these triggers
fire on ambient channel messages that match the conditions you define.

This source is opt-in per deployment and ships **disabled by default**. Enabling it requires the
operator to set the `SLACK_TRIGGERS_ENABLED` flag and configure the Slack app — see
[the Slack integration guide](integrations/SLACK.md#channel-message-triggers) for setup and the
threat model. The web form and these conditions are always available to author; messages are only
ingested once the flag is on.

### Conditions

A Slack automation must define at least a **Slack Channel** condition; the rest are optional
filters.

- **Slack Channel** (required) — the channels to watch. Pick channels by name in the web form;
  channel IDs (for example `C0123ABCD`) also work as a fallback when channel listing is unavailable.
  Only messages in these channels are considered, and the bot must be a member of each.
- **Message Text** (optional) — filter on the message text. Without it, every message in the watched
  channels triggers the automation. Pick a mode:
  - **contains** — the message contains the substring (optionally case-insensitive).
  - **exact** — the message equals the text.
  - **regex** — the message matches a regular expression. Patterns are capped in length and limited
    to the `i` and `m` flags; an invalid pattern is rejected when you save.
- **Slack User** (optional) — include or exclude specific Slack user IDs (an allowlist is the
  recommended way to limit who can trigger a run).

A message runs the automation only when **every** condition passes. The bot-mention token is
stripped before matching, and messages that `@mention` the bot are handled by the interactive
`@mention` flow instead — they never double-fire as triggers.

### Run feedback

A triggering message is marked with the 👀 reaction while its run is in flight. When the run
finishes, the agent's final response is posted as a reply in that message's thread — with links to
any pull requests it opened and to the full web session — and the reaction is cleared. A failed run
posts a short failure notice in the thread instead.

Every reply in a thread **continues the same session** — during the run and after it finishes — for
up to 7 days after the thread's first trigger, exactly like replying in an `@mention` thread. The
reply is enqueued as a follow-up turn on that session (re-spawning it from a snapshot if it had gone
idle), and the agent posts its response in-thread when the turn finishes. A follow-up does not need
to match the trigger condition — conditions gate new runs, not replies that continue an existing
thread. If a reply races the very first trigger before its session exists, it falls back to an
ephemeral "a run is already active" notice (reason `concurrent_run_active`); a reply more than 7
days after the first trigger starts a fresh run.

---

## Schedule Options

The schedule picker offers four presets and a custom mode:

| Preset         | Description                                  | Controls                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Every hour** | Runs once per hour at the top of the hour    | None                                  |
| **Daily**      | Runs once per day at a chosen time           | Hour picker (12-hour AM/PM)           |
| **Weekly**     | Runs once per week on a chosen day and time  | Day-of-week + hour picker             |
| **Monthly**    | Runs once per month on a chosen day and time | Day-of-month (1st–28th) + hour picker |
| **Custom**     | Any valid 5-field cron expression            | Text input with live validation       |

The picker shows a live preview of the next scheduled run time below the controls.

### Custom Cron Expressions

Custom expressions must use the standard 5-field format:

```
minute  hour  day-of-month  month  day-of-week
```

Examples:

| Expression      | Meaning                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `*/15 * * * *`  | Every 15 minutes                 |
| `0 9 * * *`     | Daily at 9:00 AM                 |
| `30 14 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 2:30 PM              |
| `0 0 1 * *`     | First of every month at midnight |

> **Note**: The minimum schedule interval is **15 minutes**. Expressions that fire more frequently
> (e.g., `*/5 * * * *`) are rejected.

> **Note**: Six-field expressions (with seconds) are not supported.

---

## Managing Automations

### Pause and Resume

**Pausing** an automation stops it from firing. Scheduled automations will not run on their cron,
and event-driven automations will ignore incoming events until resumed. You can pause from the
automations list or the detail page.

**Resuming** reactivates the automation. Scheduled automations calculate the next run time from the
current moment. Event-driven automations resume listening immediately. Resuming also resets the
consecutive failure counter (see [Auto-Pause](#auto-pause) below).

### Trigger Now

Click **Trigger Now** to fire a one-off run immediately. For scheduled automations, this does not
affect the next scheduled run time. Manual triggers follow the same concurrency rules as all other
runs: if a run is already active, the trigger is rejected.

### Edit

You can change an automation's name, repository context, branch, model, and instructions at any
time. For scheduled automations, you can also change the schedule and timezone. Repository-scoped
triggers require repository context; other trigger types can be changed to **No repository**.

If you update the schedule or timezone, the next run time is recalculated automatically.

### Delete

Deleting an automation stops all future runs and removes it from the list. Existing run history and
any sessions it created are preserved.

---

## Run History

Each automation's detail page shows a chronological list of runs with status, duration, and links to
the underlying session.

### Run Statuses

| Status        | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Starting**  | A session is being created for this run.                                                               |
| **Running**   | The session is actively executing.                                                                     |
| **Completed** | The session finished successfully.                                                                     |
| **Failed**    | The session encountered an error. The failure reason is shown on the run.                              |
| **Skipped**   | The run was skipped because a previous run was still active (see [Concurrent Runs](#concurrent-runs)). |

Click **View session** on any run to jump to the full session with its output and artifacts.

---

## Automation Status

Automations display one of three statuses:

| Status       | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enabled**  | Running normally and ready to respond to its trigger.                                 |
| **Degraded** | Enabled but has recent consecutive failures. The failure count is shown on the badge. |
| **Paused**   | Not firing. Either manually paused or auto-paused after repeated failures.            |

---

## Concurrent Runs

For scheduled and manual triggers, only one run per automation can be active at a time. If one of
those triggers fires while a previous run is still in progress, the new run is recorded as
**Skipped** with reason "concurrent run active".

Event-driven automations use concurrency keys instead. For inbound webhooks, retries with the same
`idempotencyKey` are treated as the same event, but separate deliveries without a shared
`idempotencyKey` can overlap.

Slack Message triggers key concurrency by thread. Replies in a thread are not skipped — for 7 days
after the thread's first trigger they continue the same session (during the run and after it
finishes), routed to that session as follow-up prompts (see the **Run feedback** note under
[Slack Message Triggers](#slack-message-triggers)).

This prevents overlapping sessions from interfering with each other on the same repository.

---

## Auto-Pause

If an automation fails **3 consecutive times**, it is automatically paused to prevent runaway
failures. The status changes to **Paused** and no further runs will start until you resume it.

To re-enable the automation, click **Resume**. This resets the failure counter. Scheduled
automations also compute their next run at that point.

Consecutive failures are tracked across both scheduled and manually triggered runs. A single
successful run resets the counter to zero.

Runs that time out (sessions running longer than 90 minutes) also count as failures toward the
auto-pause threshold.

---

## Limits

| Limit                                  | Value                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Automation name length                 | 200 characters                       |
| Instructions length                    | 10,000 characters                    |
| Minimum schedule interval              | 15 minutes                           |
| Webhook payload size                   | 64 KB                                |
| Concurrent runs per automation         | 1 for scheduled/manual triggers only |
| Consecutive failures before auto-pause | 3                                    |
| Run execution timeout                  | 90 minutes                           |
