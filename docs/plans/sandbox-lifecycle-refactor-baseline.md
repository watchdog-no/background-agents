# Sandbox lifecycle refactor: T1 verification baseline

This is the verification companion to
[COL-240](https://linear.app/colemurray/issue/COL-240/refactor-sandboxlifecyclemanager-into-focused-collaborators)
and [ADR 0004](../adr/0004-sandbox-checkpoint-and-shutdown.md), not a replacement design. The
proposed `sandbox-lifecycle-manager-refactor.md` was not present in this checkout. No production
extraction or protocol change is part of T1.

## Checkout and owners

- Starting HEAD: `4e5c1f3bce26974890a822c894651688ae6e4045` (clean `main`, tracking `origin/main`);
  research baseline: `eef911f36e704fc49104546a9cd52b584d8b9223`. Five subsequent commits change
  session visibility/indexing, Modal VM Docker-preparation failure handling, VM lookup for partially
  published tunnels, and client/provider response handling. `vm-resolve.test.ts` gains a
  Docker-unavailable regression. None extracts lifecycle responsibilities. Do not replace these
  changes with the research snapshot.
- COL-238 (heartbeat confirmation) and COL-161 (spawn-time context injection) were **In Progress**
  in Linear at inspection, not landed in this HEAD. Current watchdog/bridge and launch-context
  behavior is the tested baseline, not the proposals in those issues. Recheck at each subsequent
  task; preserve any changes that land.
- `sandbox/lifecycle/manager.ts` still owns reservation, launch choice, provider claims, recovery,
  failure/breaker accounting, public admission/readiness, access preparation, VM resolution state,
  rejected cleanup, alarm dispatch/effects, and termination flags. `decisions.ts` and
  `alarm-policy.ts` own pure policy; `ports.ts` exposes consumer boundaries; `test-helpers.ts`
  assembles manager fixtures.
- `session/sandbox-repository.ts` owns conditional SQL and encrypted access;
  `session/sandbox-shutdown.ts` plus `sandbox-shutdown-repository.ts` own durable holds, receipts,
  source retirement and recovery. `session/components.ts` wires both. `connection-authenticator.ts`
  authenticates/attaches sockets; `sandbox-events/runtime.handler.ts` reports runtime facts;
  `alarm/handler.ts` orders shutdown before lifecycle watchdogs and `alarm/scheduler.ts` persists
  shared deadlines. Queue/push use the public lifecycle policy, not direct shutdown decisions.

The manager's admission/termination flags are `isSpawningSandbox`, `isTerminatingSandbox`, and
`providerStartupPending`; VM reconciliation owns `bridgeResolution`, `bridgeRetryGeneration`,
`bridgeStartupClaim`, `bridgeResolvedStartup`, and `vmStartupAuth` today, all in that same class.
`spawnSandbox` selects startup mode, `reserveSpawnIdentity` commits the launch identity,
`claimProviderStartup` admits the provider result, `resolveUnknownVmStartup` and
`resolvePendingBridge` reconcile VM responses, `attemptRejectedStartupCleanup` retries rejected
handles, and `handleAlarm` dispatches watchdog effects. `retireShutdownAccess` is still manager
wiring from the shutdown coordinator. These are **current** owners, not extracted contracts.

## Compatibility evidence

Paths in this table are relative to `packages/control-plane/`: `L/` means `src/sandbox/lifecycle/`,
`S/` means `src/session/`, `I/` means `test/integration/`. **P**: passed in the pre-edit focused
commands below; **N**: named existing test not selected by those commands (not a pre-edit pass
claim; related session suites were run after edits as recorded below). T1 additions were run
separately. Gaps are remaining evidence limits, not permission to change behavior during extraction.

## Separate behavior gaps

These are _not_ extraction acceptance or claims of fixes. Confirm them with separate
reproducers/issues before behavior changes:

- Fresh and restore access use `updateSandboxAccess` / `updateSandboxTunnelUrls` without generation
  guards after encryption/other awaits; a replacement can receive the old artifact. The T1 real-SQL
  tests intentionally characterize only the stronger resume/bridge path. T3 adds the real-SQL
  reproducer "characterizes the unguarded fresh/restore artifact write across replacement":
  encryption yields, a new identity is reserved, then the old URL and encrypted secret land on the
  new row. The access extraction deliberately retains this behavior; a generation-guard fix is
  separate work.
- `connection-authenticator.ts` rechecks identity/credentials after `scheduleDisconnectCheck`, but
  not status; a same-generation stop during attachment can pass the final check. COL-238 proposes
  addressing this but is not landed here.
- `manager.ts` prior-generation `stopPriorProviderSandbox` clears the singleton provider handle
  after an await without comparing the replacement's generation/handle. This is distinct from the
  rejected-allocation cleanup characterized above.
- Foreground VM auth finalization uses generation **object identity** whereas bridge resolution uses
  equal-valued fields. T1 covers an inconclusive foreground lookup handing its token to an
  equal-valued bridge observation; an old-finalizer/new-auth overlap still lacks coverage. Treat a
  new safety assertion failing on this checkout as a separate bug, not a refactor regression.
- T3 characterizes another existing error boundary: "holds saved resume when its terminal secret
  read fails before startup is committed". A successful provider response followed by secret-read
  failure still marks the attempt failed and holds saved recovery. This differs from
  access-write/publication failures after committed recovery, which retain startup success. No
  boundary was moved or fixed.
- Retirement also retains the baseline's capability-based secret clearing rather than the stop
  operation's intent. Destructive watchdog/rejection/discard paths on a resumable provider can keep
  encrypted credentials. Independent synchronous clearing writes can partially fail, and shutdown's
  clear/notify-before-detach sequence can skip detachment on an exception. Explicit intent, atomic
  clearing and failure-independent detachment require a separate behavioral fix, not an extraction
  claim. `sandbox-access.test.ts` records the inherited failure boundary, not a desired safety rule.
- `providerResumesAfterStop` centralizes the original preserve-stop predicate; it does not check
  `resumeSandbox` or authorize recovery. All shipped persistent-resume providers implement resume,
  but mismatched provider objects remain possible. Adding that method check would change the
  inherited stop/credential policy. Saved retained recovery without the method already holds rather
  than spawning fresh; ordinary resume retains its separate fresh fallback. A stronger provider
  contract must preserve that distinction in separately approved work.

| `npm run test:integration -w @open-inspect/control-plane -- sandbox-early-connect session-lifecycle-alarm-recovery sandbox-shutdown sandbox-state-retention` | Passed: 4 files, 55 tests (Workerd provider substitutes, not live provider verification). |

After T1 test edits, the targeted 3-file command
`npm test -w @open-inspect/control-plane -- src/session/sandbox-repository.test.ts src/sandbox/lifecycle/rejected-allocation.test.ts src/sandbox/lifecycle/alarm-boot-budget-effects.test.ts`
passed: 98 tests. Its first run failed only because the new guard observation expected two
broadcasts when the existing path emits three; the assertion was corrected to record the actual
baseline sequence.
`npm test -w @open-inspect/control-plane -- src/sandbox/lifecycle/vm-resolve.test.ts` then passed:
21 tests. No production code was changed. Post-edit focused unit tests passed (18 files, 608 tests),
Workerd integration passed (4 files, 55 tests), and control-plane typecheck, boundary lint (2
tests), targeted Prettier and ESLint checks, and `git diff --check` passed. Shared was built before
dependent checks as recorded above. No full control-plane unit/integration sweep, bundle build, or
live-provider canary was run for T1; those remain later-story verification.

Additional post-edit command:
`npm test -w @open-inspect/control-plane -- src/session/sandbox-shutdown.test.ts src/session/sandbox-shutdown-safety.test.ts src/session/message-queue.test.ts src/session/sandbox-push-service.test.ts src/session/connection-authenticator.test.ts src/session/alarm src/session/sandbox-events/runtime.handler.test.ts`
passed (8 files, 278 tests). This includes the session-side N entries above; N still records their
pre-edit baseline scope honestly. It is not a full unit-suite run.
